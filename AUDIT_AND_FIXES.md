## ⚠️ ISSUES FOUND

### **CRITICAL: Find Players Page - Cards Not Clickable**

**Location:** `app/find-players/page.tsx`

**Problem:** 
- Player cards wrapped in `<Link>` but clicks don't navigate
- Cursor doesn't change to pointer
- Console shows no errors

**Attempted Fixes (All Failed):**
1. ✗ Removed nested buttons
2. ✗ Added explicit `href` prop
3. ✗ Checked for CSS pointer-events
4. ✗ Verified Link import from next/link
5. ✗ Tried onClick handler
6. ✗ Checked for overlapping elements

**Current Status:** UNRESOLVED - Needs fresh approach

**Workaround Options:**
1. Use router.push() with onClick instead of Link
2. Make entire card a button that navigates
3. Debug in browser dev tools to see what's blocking clicks
